# Figma AI Mastery for LLM System Builders (15-20 Hours)

## Course Philosophy: "Figma as a Tool, Not a Career"
This course is for AI engineers and LLM builders who want to use Figma tactically to accelerate their system building - not to become designers. You'll learn just enough to prototype LLM interfaces, communicate visually, and hand off to developers.

**Duration:** 3-4 weeks (15-20 hours total)  
**Target:** LLM engineers who want UI prototyping superpowers  
**Outcome:** 10x faster LLM tool validation and demo creation
